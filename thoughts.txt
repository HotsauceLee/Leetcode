DP - "optimal substructure" + "overlapping of subproblems"

Think naviely first, find the first step to solve the problem, a.k.a. find the substructure. Usually start with recursion, find Termination condition and Recurrence relation.

Then find the overlapping steps, find a way to optimize it. Usually sacrifice space to reduce time.
